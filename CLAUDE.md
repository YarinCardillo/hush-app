## Hush Refactor
When working on the hush-app project, ALWAYS read ARCHITECTURE.md before modifying any file.
This is a refactor of an existing codebase — do not create files from scratch when the existing file should be modified.
Use every skill you think would help for the task, especially dispatching multiple agents.
