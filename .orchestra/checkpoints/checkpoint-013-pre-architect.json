    "description": "Update the Caddy reverse proxy configuration to route LiveKit WebSocket traffic to the LiveKit server. This enables clients to connect to LiveKit through the main entry point.\n\n**Implementation steps:**\n1. Add LiveKit WebSocket route in Caddyfile (before the catch-all handle /* block):\n   - Route `/livekit/*` to `livekit:7880` (LiveKit's WebSocket port)\n   - Preserve WebSocket upgrade headers (Connection, Upgrade)\n   - Enable WebSocket for SFU signaling\n\n2. The /api/livekit/token endpoint is already routed via the catch-all to hush:3001, no changes needed there.\n\n**Note:** LiveKit's RTC ports (7881 and UDP 50000-60000) are exposed directly in docker-compose and don't need reverse proxy routing - only the initial WebSocket connection goes through Caddy.",
