Export a singleton instance (lazy initialization)\n2. Provide createClient(options) function that initializes the SDK client\n3. Provide getClient() function to retrieve the current client\n4. Provide destroyClient() function to cleanup and logout\n5. Support configurable homeserver URL via VITE_MATRIX_HOMESERVER_URL env var\n6. Default homeserver URL should be window.location.origin + '/_matrix'\n\nFor Vite compatibility, you may need to configure matrix-js-sdk properly. Check if any polyfills or Vite config changes are needed.\n\nFollow the singleton pattern established in client/src/lib/socket.js for consistency.",
