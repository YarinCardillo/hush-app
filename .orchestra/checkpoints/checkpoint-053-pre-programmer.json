    "description": "Initialize the Matrix crypto module after client creation and authentication.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nTask B2.2.1 added IndexedDBCryptoStore to the Matrix client. However, the crypto module itself needs to be initialized AFTER authentication. The matrix-js-sdk requires calling initCrypto() or initRustCrypto() before E2EE operations can work.\n\nCURRENT STATE:\nIn useMatrixAuth.js, after successful registration/login:\n1. Client is created with cryptoStore (via createMatrixClient)\n2. startClient() is called to begin sync\n3. Crypto module is NOT initialized\n\nREQUIRED CHANGES:\nModify useMatrixAuth.js to call initCrypto() after authentication:\n\n1. After client creation and credential setting, call:\n   ```javascript\n   // Initialize crypto module for E2EE support\n   await client.initCrypto();\n   ```\n\n2. This must happen BEFORE startClient() is called\n\n3. Add error handling for crypto initialization failure\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES:\n- initCrypto() is async and must be awaited\n- It can throw if crypto store setup fails\n- The call must happen after client has credentials (userId, accessToken, deviceId)\n- matrix-js-sdk v40+ may prefer initRustCrypto() but fallback to initCrypto() if unavailable\n\nFILES TO MODIFY:\n- client/src/hooks/useMatrixAuth.js\n\nLOCATION HINTS:\nSearch for 'startClient' in useMatrixAuth.js - initCrypto() should be called just before it.",

Added IndexedDBCryptoStore import (line 2):\n   - Import path: 'matrix-js-sdk/lib/crypto/store/indexeddb-crypto-store'\n   - Verified import path correct for matrix-js-sdk v40.3.0-rc.0\n\n2. Created crypto store in createMatrixClient() (lines 27-31):\n   - Instantiated IndexedDBCryptoStore with global indexedDB and database name 'hush-crypto'\n   - Store created BEFORE client instantiation to ensure availability\n\n3. Passed cryptoStore to createClient() (lines 33-37):\n   - Added cryptoStore to clientConfig object\n   - Positioned before ...options spread to allow override if needed\n\n4.
