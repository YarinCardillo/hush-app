    "description": "Remove the Socket.io chat messaging code from the server. Chat is now handled by Matrix, so the server-side Socket.io chat events are dead code.\n\nFiles to modify:\n- server/src/signaling/socketHandlers.js\n\nSpecific removals:\n\n1. Remove the messageTimestamps rate limiting Map (line 7):\n```javascript\n// DELETE: const messageTimestamps = new Map();\n```\n\n2. Remove the entire 'sendMessage' event handler (lines 274-322):\n```javascript\n// DELETE: socket.on('sendMessage', ...) block\n```\n\n3. Remove the messageTimestamps cleanup in the disconnect handler (line 352):\n```javascript\n// DELETE: messageTimestamps.delete(peerId);\n```\n\nKeep intact:\n- All mediasoup handlers (getRouterRtpCapabilities, createWebRtcTransport, connectTransport, produce, consume, resumeConsumer, closeProducer, updateProducerAppData)\n- getPeers handler\n- e2eKeyExchange handler (used for media E2E, not chat)\n- peerJoined/peerLeft events\n- All room and peer management logic\n\nVerification:\n- Server should start without errors\n- No 'sendMessage' or 'messageReceived' events in the file\n- No messageTimestamps references in the file",
