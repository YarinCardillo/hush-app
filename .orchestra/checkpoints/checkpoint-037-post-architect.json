    "title": "Fix Chat Visibility, Input Clearing, and Unwatch Button Issues",
    "description": "Three related issues reported in FEEDBACK.md:\n\n1. CHAT MESSAGES NOT VISIBLE TO OTHER MEMBERS:\n   - Root cause: Matrix room ID not properly shared between users\n   - In Chat.jsx:144, matrixRoomId comes from sessionStorage ('hush_matrixRoomId')\n   - When users join an existing room, they may not be joining the same Matrix room\n   - Need to verify Matrix room ID is properly propagated to all room members\n   - Likely the Home.jsx join flow doesn't store the correct Matrix room ID\n\n2. CHAT INPUT TEXT REMAINS AFTER SENDING:\n   - Chat.jsx:217 calls setInputText('') which should work\n   - Possibly a timing/state issue - verify the message actually sends successfully\n   - Check if there's a React strict mode double-render issue\n   - Add error logging to see if sendMessage is failing silently\n\n3. UNWATCH ('X') BUTTON NOT WORKING:\n   - In Room.jsx:569-573, onUnwatch callback uses stream.producerId\n   - But allStreams array (line 419-427) sets id: trackSid, not producerId\n   - Property name mismatch: stream.producerId is undefined\n   - Fix: Change onUnwatch={() => unwatchScreen(stream.producerId)} to unwatchScreen(stream.id)\n   - OR: Add producerId property when building allStreams",
