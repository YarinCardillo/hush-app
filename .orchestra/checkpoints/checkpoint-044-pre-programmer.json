    "title": "Handle Stale Encrypted Matrix Rooms on Room Creation",
    "description": "USER TESTING (iter.43) FAILED with error:\n\"This room is configured to use encryption, but your client does not support encryption.\"\n\nACTUAL ROOT CAUSE:\nThe room `!EfkjVUEYdjalPAcUcH:localhost` was created in an earlier iteration when E2EE was\nstill enabled. Matrix protocol specification states: \"Once enabled, encryption can NEVER be\ndisabled.\" (MATRIX_REFERENCE.md line 331)\n\nWhen Home.jsx calls createRoom() with room_alias_name \"bbbb\", if that alias already exists in\nSynapse from a previous session, the Matrix SDK may:\n1. Return M_ROOM_IN_USE error\n2. Or silently return the existing encrypted room\n\nThe code at iteration 43 correctly creates rooms without E2EE, but stale encrypted rooms from\nearlier development sessions persist in Synapse database.\n\nSOLUTION:\nIn Home.jsx handleSubmit() for mode === 'create', wrap createRoom() in a try-catch:\n1. If createRoom fails with M_ROOM_IN_USE, append a random 4-character suffix to room_alias_name\n2. Retry createRoom with the unique alias (e.g., \"bbbb-a3f9\")\n3. Store the actual room name (with suffix) in sessionStorage so join path works correctly\n4. Display the full room name to user so they can share it with others\n\nThis ensures fresh unencrypted rooms are always created, even when old encrypted aliases exist.",

  "last_programmer_output": "Task BUG-003-fix3 completed: Fixed chat sendMessage error by ensuring Matrix room sync before navigation.\n\nROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:\nThe Matrix SDK has inconsistent return types and async behavior between createRoom() and joinRoom():\n\n1. ROOM ID PROPERTY MISMATCH (Suspected Primary Issue):\n   - createRoom() returns: { room_id: string } (snake_case)\n   - joinRoom() returns: Room object with { roomId: string } (camelCase)\n   Both code paths were already using the correct property names, so this was NOT the issue.\n\n2. ASYNC SYNC RACE CONDITION (Actual Root Cause):\n   - createRoom() and joinRoom() complete the API call but room may not be in client.getRooms() yet\n   - Matrix client syncs rooms asynchronously via the sync loop\n   - Chat.jsx calls client.getRoom(matrixRoomId) which returns null if sync hasn't completed\n   - When getRoom() returns null, sendMessage() throws \"Room not found in Matrix client store\"\n   - The error was caught and logged, but input clearing at line 225 never executed\n\nSOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:\n1. Added sync wait loops in Home.jsx for BOTH create and join paths\n2. After createRoom() or joinRoom(), poll client.getRoom() up to 50 times (5 seconds total)\n3. Only navigate to Room page after confirming room exists in client store\n4. Added comprehensive diagnostic logging to both Home.jsx and Chat.jsx",
