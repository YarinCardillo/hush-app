    "description": "**CRITICAL BUG:** The server cannot start because roomManager.js imports from the deleted mediasoupManager.js.\n\nError:\n```\nError [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '.../server/src/media/mediasoupManager.js' imported from .../server/src/rooms/roomManager.js\n```\n\nThe roomManager.js still contains:\n- Line 3: `import mediasoupManager from '../media/mediasoupManager.js';`\n- Line 31: `const router = await mediasoupManager.createRouter();`\n- Lines 39, 144: references to `room.router`\n- Lines 93-95, 115-117, 134-137: references to peer.transports, peer.producers, peer.consumers (mediasoup objects)\n\n**Changes required:**\n\n1. **Remove mediasoup import** (line 3)\n\n2. **Remove mediasoup router creation** (line 31) - replace with simple room creation without router\n\n3. **Remove router property** from room object (line 39)\n\n4. **Remove router.close()** call in removePeer (line 144)\n\n5. **Remove mediasoup transport/producer/consumer properties** from peer object (lines 93-95) - these are no longer needed since LiveKit handles media\n\n6. **Remove transport closing logic** in removePeer (lines 134-137) and resetPeer (lines 115-117)\n\n7. **Keep all room validation logic**: password hashing/verification, participant limits, room list, peer tracking\n\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\n1. No import of mediasoupManager in roomManager.js\n2. No references to router, transports, producers, consumers in roomManager.js\n3. Server starts successfully (`node src/index.js` runs without error)\n4. `node --check server/src/index.js` passes\n5. Room creation/join/list functionality preserved (password validation, participant limits)\n6. resourcePool.js unchanged",
