    "description": "Add Caddy as a reverse proxy to route traffic appropriately. Caddy will be the single entry point for external traffic.\n\nRouting requirements:\n1. Route /_matrix/* to synapse:8008 (Matrix homeserver APIs)\n2. Route / (everything else) to hush:3001 (the Hush client/server)\n3. Configure CORS headers for Matrix client access\n4. Use Caddy's automatic HTTPS (disabled for localhost development)\n\nNotes:\n- The Hush service currently exposes port 3001 - Caddy will proxy to it\n- Synapse is on port 8008 internally\n- For local dev, use http://localhost as the site address\n- Ensure WebSocket upgrade headers are passed through for Socket.io",
