    "description": "User testing revealed the root cause of BUG-002 is NOT just the missing room alias (that was fixed), but the room PRESET. Current code uses `preset: 'private_chat'` which requires explicit invitation to join.\n\nThe 403 'you are not invited in this room' error confirms this - the room exists and has an alias, but non-invited users cannot join.\n\nFIX REQUIRED in client/src/pages/Home.jsx:\n- Change `preset: 'private_chat'` to `preset: 'public_chat'`\n- Change `visibility: 'private'` to `visibility: 'public'` (optional but recommended for consistency)\n\nThe `public_chat` preset allows anyone to join without invitation, which matches Hush's design: share room name → anyone can join.\n\nNOTE: The encryption initial_state should remain - public rooms CAN still have E2EE enabled.",
