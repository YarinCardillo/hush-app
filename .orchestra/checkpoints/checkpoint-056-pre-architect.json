    "description": "Verify and enhance the Chat.jsx component to properly handle encrypted messages now that E2EE is enabled.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nWith the full E2EE infrastructure operational:\n- B2.2.1: IndexedDBCryptoStore provides persistent key storage\n- B2.2.2: initCrypto() initializes crypto in all auth flows\n- B2.2.3: Synapse encryption defaults re-enabled\n- B2.3.1: Room creation verified E2EE-compatible\n\nChat messages are now encrypted by default. The Chat component must properly handle decrypted message events.\n\nTASKS:\n\n1. Review Chat.jsx message handling:\n   - Verify the timeline listener handles decrypted events correctly\n   - Matrix SDK auto-decrypts messages when crypto is initialized\n   - Check event type handling (m.room.message vs m.room.encrypted)\n\n2. Add diagnostic logging:\n   - Log crypto status when Chat mounts\n   - Log message event types received (encrypted vs decrypted)\n   - Help diagnose any E2EE message issues\n\n3. Verify sendMessage works with encryption:\n   - Matrix SDK auto-encrypts when room has encryption enabled\n   - Verify no explicit encryption config needed in sendMessage()\n   - Check input clears after successful send\n\nFILES TO REVIEW/MODIFY:\n- client/src/components/Chat.jsx\n\nACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:\n1. npm run build --prefix client succeeds\n2. Chat.jsx properly receives timeline events (m.room.message after decryption)\n3. sendMessage() does not need explicit encryption config (SDK handles it)\n4. Diagnostic logging added for crypto status on mount\n5. Diagnostic logging added for message event types",

Matrix SDK auto-decrypts when crypto is initialized. Add diagnostic logging to confirm E2EE message flow.\n\nRemaining B2 tasks:\n- B2.3.2: Handle encrypted messages in Chat (ASSIGNED)\n- B2.4.1: Comprehensive E2EE testing\n- B2.4.2: Document E2EE implementation",
  "last_programmer_output": "Task B2.3.2 completed: Enhanced Chat.jsx to handle encrypted messages with E2EE diagnostic logging.\n\nTASK IMPLEMENTATION:\nAdded crypto status verification and message event type diagnostic logging to the Chat component to properly handle encrypted messages now that E2EE is fully operational.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nWith the complete E2EE infrastructure in place:\n- B2.2.1: IndexedDBCryptoStore provides persistent key storage\n- B2.2.2: initCrypto() initializes crypto in all auth flows (loginAsGuest, login, register)\n- B2.2.3: Synapse encryption defaults re-enabled (encryption_enabled_by_default_for_room_type: all)\n- B2.3.1: Room creation verified E2EE-compatible with diagnostic logging\n\nChat messages are now encrypted by default when rooms are created. The Matrix SDK automatically decrypts encrypted messages when the crypto module is initialized, emitting them as EventType.RoomMessage events to the timeline listener.\n\nCHANGES IMPLEMENTED:\n\n1. Added crypto status logging on Chat mount (client/src/components/Chat.jsx:158-165):\n   - Logs crypto status when Chat component mounts using client.isCryptoEnabled()\n   - Includes cryptoEnabled, roomId, deviceId, and userId for debugging\n   - Provides visibility into whether crypto module is initialized when Chat starts\n   - Helps diagnose timing issues where Chat might mount before crypto is ready\n\n2. Added message event type diagnostic logging in timeline handler (client/src/components/Chat.jsx:186-194):\n   - Logs all timeline events with their type, sender, and eventId\n   - Shows whether events are encrypted (m.room.encrypted) or decrypted (m.room.message)\n   - Helps diagnose E2EE message flow and decryption issues\n   - Moved roomId check before event type filtering to capture all event types\n\n3. Verified existing message handling implementation (client/src/components/Chat.jsx:171-179, 196-205):\n   - Timeline listener filters for EventType.RoomMessage (correct - SDK auto-decrypts)\n   - Message loading from timeline uses same filter (correct)\n   - Matrix SDK handles decryption automatically when crypto is initialized\n   - No changes needed to existing event handling logic\n\n4. Verified sendMessage implementation (client/src/components/Chat.jsx:238-241):\n   - Uses standard Matrix message format: msgtype: 'm.text', body: trimmed\n   - NO explicit encryption parameters (correct - SDK auto-encrypts)\n   - Matrix SDK automatically encrypts messages when room has encryption enabled\n   - Input clears after successful send (line 243: setInputText(''))\n\nKEY OBSERVATIONS:\n\n1. Message Timeline Handling:\n   - Current implementation filters for EventType.RoomMessage\n   - Matrix SDK emits m.room.encrypted events when receiving encrypted messages\n   - SDK automatically decrypts and re-emits as EventType.RoomMessage\n   - Timeline listener correctly handles decrypted messages\n   - New diagnostic logging will show both event types for debugging\n\n2. Message Sending:\n   - sendMessage() uses standard message format with no encryption config\n   - SDK automatically encrypts when room state includes m.room.encryption\n   - Synapse sets this state automatically (encryption_enabled_by_default_for_room_type: all)\n   - Implementation is correct and E2EE-compatible\n\n3. Crypto Initialization Timing:\n   - Crypto initialized in auth flow (B2.2.2) before startClient()\n   - By the time Chat mounts, crypto should be ready\n   - New diagnostic logging will confirm crypto status on mount\n   - Helps identify edge cases where Chat loads before crypto init completes\n\nFILES MODIFIED:\n- client/src/components/Chat.jsx\n  - Lines 158-165: Added crypto status logging when component mounts\n  - Lines 186-194: Added event type diagnostic logging in timeline handler\n  - Lines 171-179: Existing message loading (verified correct, no changes)\n  - Lines 196-205: Existing timeline listener (verified correct, no changes)\n  - Lines 238-241: Existing sendMessage (verified correct, no changes)\n\nACCEPTANCE CRITERIA VERIFICATION:\n✓ npm run build --prefix client succeeds with no errors (verified - build completed in 3.32s)\n✓ Chat.jsx timeline listener handles m.room.message events (verified - filters for EventType.RoomMessage at line 196)\n✓ sendMessage() call does not include explicit encryption parameters (verified - lines 238-241 use standard format only)\n✓ Diagnostic console.log for crypto status when Chat component mounts (verified - added at lines 159-165)\n✓ Diagnostic console.log showing message event types received (verified - added at lines 187-194)\n\nCLAUDE.md COMPLIANCE:\n- Diagnostic logging only - minimal code changes (+19 lines)\n- No new functions added - changes inline in existing useEffect\n- Clear variable naming: cryptoReady, eventType\n- No magic numbers or hardcoded strings\n- useEffect callback length: ~50 lines (within acceptable range for component lifecycle hook with message loading and event subscription)\n- handleTimelineEvent callback: ~24 lines (acceptable for event handler with diagnostic logging)\n\nBUILD VERIFICATION:\nExecuted: npm run build --prefix client\nResult: ✓ built in 3.32s with no errors\nWarnings: Expected Vite warnings for dynamic imports (noise gate worklet) and chunk size (matrixClient bundle) - unrelated to this change\n\nGIT DIFF SUMMARY:\n- +9 lines: Crypto status logging on mount (lines 158-165)\n- +10 lines: Event type diagnostic logging in timeline handler (lines 186-194)\n- Total: +19 lines of diagnostic code\n\nIMPACT:\n- Chat component now logs crypto status when mounting\n- Message event types now logged for E2EE debugging\n- Visibility into encrypted vs decrypted message flow\n- Helps diagnose issues with E2EE message handling\n- No functional changes - diagnostic logging only\n- Ready for manual testing with encrypted Matrix rooms\n\nNEXT STEPS:\nReady for architect review. After approval, proceed to B2.4.1 (Comprehensive E2EE testing).",
