    "description": "Update Room.jsx and related components to use useRoom instead of useMediasoup.\n\n**Context:**\nRoom.jsx currently imports and uses useMediasoup for all WebRTC functionality. We need to replace this with useRoom (LiveKit-based). The API surfaces are similar but have different naming conventions.\n\n**Mapping from useMediasoup to useRoom:**\n- `producers` -> `localTracks` (Map of local tracks by sid)\n- `consumers` -> `remoteTracks` (Map of remote tracks by sid)\n- `peers` -> `participants`\n- `initDevice` -> (not needed, room handles device init)\n- `captureScreen` + `produceScreen` -> `publishScreen`\n- `switchScreenSource` -> `switchScreenSource` (same)\n- `changeQuality` -> `changeQuality` (same)\n- `startWebcam` -> `publishWebcam`\n- `startMic` -> `publishMic`\n- `stopProducer` -> `unpublishScreen`, `unpublishMic`, `unpublishWebcam`\n- `consumeProducer` -> (automatic in LiveKit)\n- `setPeers` -> `setParticipants`\n- `availableScreens` -> `availableScreens` (same)\n- `watchedScreens` -> `watchedScreens` (same)\n- `loadingScreens` -> `loadingScreens` (same)\n- `watchScreen` -> `watchScreen` (same)\n- `unwatchScreen` -> `unwatchScreen` (same)\n\n**Implementation steps:**\n\n1. Update Room.jsx imports:\n   - Remove: `import { connectSocket, disconnectSocket, socketRequest } from '../lib/socket';`\n   - Remove: `import { useMediasoup } from '../hooks/useMediasoup';`\n   - Add: `import { useRoom } from '../hooks/useRoom';`\n\n2. Replace useMediasoup destructuring with useRoom:\n   - Update all variable names per mapping above\n   - `isReady` and `error` remain the same\n\n3. Update connection logic:\n   - Remove Socket.io connect/disconnect code from useEffect\n   - Add call to `connectRoom(roomName, displayName)` where displayName comes from sessionStorage 'hush_displayName'\n   - Remove `initDevice()` call (not needed)\n   - Remove `socketRequest('getPeers')` and related peer iteration (LiveKit handles this automatically)\n   - Update cleanup to call `disconnectRoom()`\n\n4. Update screen share handlers:\n   - `handleScreenShare`: Replace `captureScreen` + `produceScreen` + `stopProducer` with `publishScreen` / `unpublishScreen`\n   - `handleSwitchSource`: Keep using `switchScreenSource`\n   - `handleQualityChange`: Keep using `changeQuality`\n\n5. Update mic/webcam handlers:\n   - Replace `startMic`/`stopProducer` pattern with `publishMic`/`unpublishMic`\n   - Replace `startWebcam`/`stopProducer` pattern with `publishWebcam`/`unpublishWebcam`\n\n6. Update stream rendering:\n   - Check how `producers`/`consumers` are iterated and update to use `localTracks`/`remoteTracks`\n   - Each track entry has `{ track, source }` for local or `{ track, participant, kind, source }` for remote\n   - Track objects have `.mediaStreamTrack` for the actual MediaStreamTrack\n   - For video: `track.attach()` returns an HTMLVideoElement or use `track.mediaStreamTrack` with srcObject\n\n7. Update StreamView.jsx:\n   - Currently receives a `stream` or `track` prop\n   - LiveKit tracks use `.attach()` method or `.mediaStreamTrack` for srcObject\n   - Update to handle LiveKit track objects\n\n8. Update ScreenShareCard.jsx:\n   - Should work with availableScreens/watchedScreens/loadingScreens (API unchanged)\n\n9. Update Controls.jsx:\n   - Should work unchanged as it receives callbacks from Room.jsx\n\n**Important:**\n- Do NOT delete useMediasoup.js yet (that's task B2.4)\n- Do NOT remove socket.js yet (that's task B2.4)\n- Focus only on making Room.jsx work with useRoom",

Build succeeds with no errors (✓)**\n- Build completed in 2.55s\n- 10 chunks generated\n- Expected warning: \"new URL('./noiseGateWorklet.js', import.meta.url) doesn't exist at build time\"\n- No build errors, all acceptance criteria verified\n\n**Files Modified:**\n\n1. client/src/pages/Room.jsx:\n   - Line 3: Added import { Track } from 'livekit-client'\n   - Line 4: Changed import to useRoom from '../hooks/useRoom'\n   - Lines 190-211: Updated destructuring from useMediasoup to useRoom (localTracks, remoteTracks, participants, connectRoom, disconnectRoom, publishScreen, unpublishScreen, publishMic, unpublishMic, publishWebcam, unpublishWebcam)\n   - Lines 226-255: Replaced Socket.io connection logic with LiveKit connectRoom/disconnectRoom\n   - Lines 270-294: Updated handleScreenShare and handleQualityPick to use publishScreen/unpublishScreen\n   - Lines 301-358: Updated handleMic/handleWebcam and device pick handlers to use publish*/unpublish* pattern\n   - Line 378: Updated handleLeave to call disconnectRoom\n   - Lines 442-526: Rewrote stream rendering to iterate localTracks/remoteTracks Maps\n   - Lines 528-537: Updated unwatched screens logic for Track.Source.ScreenShare\n   - Line 581: Updated participant count to participants.length + 1\n   - Lines 640-651: Updated participants sidebar to map over participants array\n\n2. client/src/hooks/useRoom.js:\n   - Lines 838-841: Removed dead code setParticipants wrapper function\n   - Line 884: Removed setParticipants from exports\n   - Fixed ESLint error: \"The symbol 'setParticipants' has already been declared\"\n\n**Implementation Notes:**\n- StreamView.jsx requires MediaStreamTrack objects, so we use info.track.mediaStreamTrack from LiveKit tracks\n- Track.Source constants used for pairing video/audio (ScreenShare->ScreenShareAudio, Camera->Microphone)\n- Participants state managed internally by useRoom via ParticipantConnected/Disconnected events\n- Click-to-watch feature preserved: availableScreens populated from TrackPublished events, watchScreen calls publication.setSubscribed(true)\n- All Socket.io code completely removed from Room.jsx\n- useMediasoup.js and socket.js NOT deleted (as specified - that's task B2.4)\n- Code follows CLAUDE.md standards: Single Responsibility, clear variable names, proper error handling",
