    "title": "Fix Matrix Room Joining - Add Room Alias on Creation",
    "description": "Users cannot join already-created rooms. The Matrix join call fails with 404 because no room alias exists.\n\nROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:\nIn Home.jsx, when creating a Matrix room (lines 285-297), the code uses `client.createRoom()` but does NOT set a `room_alias_name`. This means:\n1. Creator creates room → gets internal room_id like `!abc123:localhost` (no alias)\n2. Joiner tries to join via `#roomName:localhost` (alias) → 404 because alias doesn't exist\n\nThe 409 error from `/api/rooms/create` is expected behavior - the backend roomManager correctly rejects duplicate room names. The actual bug is the missing Matrix room alias.\n\nFIX:\nAdd `room_alias_name: roomName` to the createRoom options in Home.jsx. This creates a room alias that joiners can use.\n\nIMPORTANT: The `room_alias_name` should be the local part only (e.g., 'duck'), NOT the full alias (e.g., '#duck:localhost'). The Matrix server appends the server name automatically.",
