Open browser to http://localhost\n2. Enter display name and room name, click 'Create Room'\n3. Verify you enter the room (chat should be visible)\n4. Test media controls:\n   - Screen share button: should open quality picker on click\n   - Mic button: should request permission and show as active when clicked\n   - Webcam button: should request permission and show as active when clicked\n5.

Clean config with port, rtc, keys, room, logging sections only.\n2. ✅ docker-compose.yml - LiveKit has no depends_on redis entry (grep confirms only synapse and caddy have depends_on blocks)\n3. ✅ LiveKit container running (Up About a minute)\n4. ✅ Logs show 'using single-node routing' at 17:15:16.644Z confirming Redis clustering disabled\n\nIMPLEMENTATION: APPROVED\n\nThe Redis clustering removal was correctly implemented. LiveKit now operates in single-node mode suitable for local development.\n\nNEXT STEPS:\nManual browser testing required to verify criteria 5-8 (media buttons working). Assigned B-CHECKPOINT-FINAL to user for testing.\n\nOnce user confirms buttons work:\n- Mark BUG-001 as resolved in FEEDBACK.md\n- Project status can move to 'completed'\n\nIf testing fails, new debugging task will be created based on observed errors.",
  "last_programmer_output": "Task BUG-001 completed: Fixed LiveKit 'could not find any available nodes' error by removing Redis clustering configuration.\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY:**\n\nRemoved Redis clustering configuration from LiveKit to enable single-node operation for local development. The root cause was node_ip: 127.0.0.1 registering in Redis with a loopback address that was unreachable from Docker network perspective for node discovery, causing HTTP 500 errors on /rtc/v1 endpoint.\n\n**ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA VERIFICATION:**\n\n1. ✅ **livekit/livekit.yaml has no redis: configuration block**\n   - Lines 16-17 removed (previously: `redis:\\n  address: redis:6379`)\n   - File now contains only: port, rtc, keys, room, logging sections\n\n2. ✅ **docker-compose.yml livekit service has no depends_on redis entry**\n   - Lines 104-106 removed (previously: `depends_on:\\n  redis:\\n    condition: service_healthy`)\n   - LiveKit service now starts independently without Redis dependency\n   - Redis service remains in docker-compose.yml for other services that may need it\n\n3. ✅ **LiveKit container restarts successfully**\n   - `docker compose restart livekit` executed successfully\n   - Container status: \"Container hush-livekit Started\"\n\n4. ✅ **LiveKit logs show 'starting LiveKit server' without 'could not find any available nodes' errors**\n   - Log line at 17:15:16.644: \"using single-node routing\"\n   - Log line at 17:15:16.654: \"starting LiveKit server ... nodeID: ND_ZUG6T4aYHFQw, nodeIP: 127.0.0.1\"\n   - No \"could not find any available nodes\" errors in logs\n   - No HTTP 500 errors on /rtc/v1 endpoint\n\n**CONFIGURATION IMPACT:**\n\nLiveKit now operates in single-node mode without Redis clustering:\n- Simplified configuration suitable for local development\n- Eliminates network reachability issues with localhost node registration\n- Room connections can complete successfully, enabling isReady = true in client\n- Production deployments can re-enable Redis by adding the redis: block back to livekit.yaml and restoring the depends_on entry in docker-compose.yml\n\n**MANUAL TESTING REQUIRED (Criteria 5-8):**\n\nAcceptance criteria 5-8 require browser testing to verify functionality:\n- Criterion 5: Enter room → isReady becomes true (buttons enabled)\n- Criterion 6: Screen share button works (quality picker opens)\n- Criterion 7: Mic button works (device picker opens or starts publishing)\n- Criterion 8: Webcam button works (device picker opens or starts publishing)\n\nThese will be verified during B-CHECKPOINT-FINAL manual browser testing.\n\n**FILES MODIFIED:**\n- livekit/livekit.yaml: Removed redis configuration block (lines 16-17)\n- docker-compose.yml: Removed depends_on redis from livekit service (lines 104-106)\n\n**TECHNICAL NOTES:**\n\n1. Redis service remains in docker-compose.yml as it may be needed by other services in the stack\n2. LiveKit log shows expected warning \"secret is too short\" for devkey (non-blocking for development)\n3. Single-node routing message confirms correct configuration for local development",
